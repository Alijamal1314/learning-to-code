# File: variables.py
# Goal: Understand how variables store and reference data
# What I learned:
# - Variables store values in memory
# - Variables can be reassigned
# - Data types like strings and integers affect behavior
# Next step:
# - Practice using variables with user input
# - Combine variables with conditionals and loops
