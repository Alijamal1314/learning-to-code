Documenting my transition into software development through foundational programming and projects.
# Ali Jamal Naqvi – Learning & Projects

This repository documents my transition into software development, beginning with foundational programming concepts and progressing into hands-on projects.

## Current Focus
- Introductory programming (Python fundamentals)
- Core concepts: variables, functions, conditionals, loops
- Problem-solving and debugging
- Web development basics (HTML, CSS)

## Background
I come from a business and operations background, with experience working in fast-paced environments, managing systems, and improving workflows. I’m now applying that same problem-solving mindset to learning software development.

## Learning Approach
I focus on building a strong foundation by writing small, clear examples for each concept.
Each script includes learning notes and next steps to reinforce understanding and track progress.

## In Progress
- Python practice exercises
- Small utility scripts
- Introductory web projects
- Shopify-related experimentation

This repository will be updated regularly as I continue building and learning.
