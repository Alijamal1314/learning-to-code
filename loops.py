# File: loops.py
# Goal: Practice basic for-loops and while-loops
# What I learned:
# - for loops iterate over a fixed range
# - while loops run until a condition becomes false
# Next step:
# - Refactor this into functions
# - Replace hardcoded values with user input



# For loop example
print("For loop example:")

for number in range(1, 6):
    print("Number:", number)

print("-----")

# While loop example
print("While loop example:")

count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print("Count:", count)
    count += 1
