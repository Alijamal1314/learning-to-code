# File: functions.py
# Goal: Practice defining and calling functions
# What I learned:
# - A function groups reusable code into a named block
# - Parameters let you pass data in; return gives data back
# - Calling a function runs its code
# Next step:
# - Write 2–3 small functions and call them from a main section
# - Add user input and pass it into functions



def greet(name):
    print("Hello,", name)

greet("Jamal")
greet("Shopify")
