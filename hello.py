# File: hello.py
# Goal: Write and run a simple Python program
# What I learned:
# - How to print output to the console
# - How Python executes code top to bottom
# - How to run a basic script
# Next step:
# - Accept user input instead of hardcoded values
# - Use variables and functions to expand this program


print("Hello, world! This is my first Python file.")
